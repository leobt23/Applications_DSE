Benchmarking anomaly detection techniques in the fraud detection domain

High performing fraud detection models are typically based on supervised learning. In practice, one may need to wait multiple months in order to collect the required labeled data and to subsequently train and deploy a supervised model. Therefore, transactions can go unprotected during an extended period before a custom detection model is activated. On the other hand, unsupervised learning does not require labeled data. Moreover, fraud patterns are typically anomalies given the context of normal activity. It is therefore natural to resort to unsupervised anomaly detection methods to bridge the initial period where a supervised model is not feasible. The main objective of this work is to benchmark various unsupervised anomaly detection techniques on open source fraud detection datasets (e.g. this dataset). We foresee roughly the following steps during this project:
Data exploration
Supervised baseline(s)
Unsupervised models (classic & deep learning models)
Reporting
