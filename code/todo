- 27 such transactions with 0 euros were a fraudulent transactions 27/492 = 5%
- Can we group into sequences?
- Escolher o melhor modelo e fazer treino conforme
- NN a funcionar;
- Models (OneClassSVM, IsolationForest, Autoencoders)
- Supervised Encoding Methods
- Approaching for Novel Categories
- Spliting w/ - Undersampling, Oversampling , both together or not;
- Escrever relat√≥rio;

Some considerations:
Verify accuracy with and without preprocessing
Never test on the oversampled or undersampled dataset.
If we want to implement cross validation, remember to oversample or undersample your training data during cross-validation, not before!
