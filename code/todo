EDA:

- Test Dataprep and AutoViz
- Scaled amount and scaled time are the columns with scaled values.
- Fit distributions
- Features importance (is it only for models?)
- Can we group into sequences?
- Fraud rate over time
- 27 such transactions with 0 euros were a fraudulent transactions 27/492 = 5%
- Distribution (Fraud Transactions and Not fraud)
- Outliers (https://www.kaggle.com/code/nareshbhat/outlier-the-silent-killer)
- Dimensionality Reduction and Clustering, t-SNE

  pr√©-processing:

- Data clean
- Scale
- Supervised Encoding Methods
- Approaching for Novel Categories
- Spliting w/ - Undersampling, Oversampling , both together or not
- Correlation after
- Correlation boxplot
- resampling and simple logistic regression classifier.

Some considerations:
Never test on the oversampled or undersampled dataset.
If we want to implement cross validation, remember to oversample or undersample your training data during cross-validation, not before!
Don't use accuracy score as a metric with imbalanced datasets (will be usually high and misleading), instead use f1-score, precision/recall score or confusion matrix
